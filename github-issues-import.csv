"FEAT: Implement Incremental Indexing Mechanism","**Problem Statement:**
The current indexing approach performs full re-indexing of the entire knowledge base on each update, resulting in poor performance, especially with large knowledge bases containing thousands of notes.

**Proposed Solution:**
Implement an incremental indexing mechanism that tracks changes to notes (additions, modifications, deletions) and updates the index incrementally based on these changes, rather than performing full re-indexing on each update.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The incremental indexing mechanism should process updates to 1000 notes within 10 seconds
2. Maintain index consistency with a correctness rate of at least 99.9% based on manual validation
3. Reduce average indexing time for subsequent updates by at least 80% compared to full re-indexing
4. Memory footprint should remain under 100MB during indexing operations","feature,priority:high,performance",Foundation
"FEAT: Implement Vector Database Layer for Semantic Search","**Problem Statement:**
The current search mechanism relies on traditional keyword-based search, which may not effectively capture the semantic relationships and contextual meaning of the content in the knowledge base.

**Proposed Solution:**
Implement a vector database layer that converts the content of notes into vector embeddings using a pre-trained language model, and enables semantic search capabilities that can retrieve relevant notes based on the semantic similarity of their content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Generate vector embeddings for 1000 notes within 60 seconds
2. Provide semantic search results with a relevance score of at least 0.8 for at least 80% of search queries
3. Memory footprint should remain under 500MB
4. Integrate seamlessly with existing search interface and functionality","feature,priority:high,enhancement",Foundation
"FEAT: Implement Automated Link Suggestions","**Problem Statement:**
The current system lacks the ability to automatically suggest relevant links between notes based on semantic similarity or shared concepts.

**Proposed Solution:**
Implement a machine learning-based link suggestion engine that analyzes the content of notes and suggests relevant connections based on semantic relationships, shared keywords, or conceptual overlap.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Suggest at least 5 relevant links for any given note
2. Achieve accuracy rate of at least 80% based on manual validation
3. Integrate seamlessly with existing note editing interface

The current system lacks the ability to automatically detect and report broken internal links within the knowledge base.

**Proposed Solution:**
Implement a link validation and repair mechanism that scans all internal links in the knowledge base, identifies broken or invalid links, and provides suggestions for repairing or updating these links.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Detect at least 90% of broken internal links in a test knowledge base containing 1000 notes with 5000 internal links
2. Provide accurate repair suggestions for at least 80% of detected broken links

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Cache at least 1000 frequently accessed notes within 10 seconds

"FEAT: Implement Knowledge Graph Visualization","**Problem Statement:**
The current system lacks the ability to visualize the relationships and connections between notes in the knowledge base as an interactive knowledge graph.

**Proposed Solution:**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Render a knowledge base containing 1000 notes and 5000 relationships within 5 seconds

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Refactored module consists of at least 3 distinct modules/classes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Reduce average search response times by at least 30% for large knowledge bases (1000+ notes)
2. Maintain or improve search accuracy and relevance
3. Integrate seamlessly with existing search interface","enhancement,priority:medium,performance","Week 5"
"ENHANCEMENT: Improve Note Ingestion and Indexing Reliability","**Problem Statement:**
