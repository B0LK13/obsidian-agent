# 🎬 Obsidian Agent Demo Guide

Follow these steps to demonstrate the full power of the modernized Obsidian Agent.

## Phase 1: The Semantic Brain
1. **Show Indexing:** Run `Rebuild Semantic Index`. Explain that we are moving from keywords to conceptual embeddings.
2. **Show Semantic Search:** Search for something that doesn't share exact words with your notes.
   * *Example:* Search for "Fixing my car" when your note is titled "Automotive Repair".

## Phase 2: The Autonomous Agent
1. **Show Multi-step Reasoning:** Run `Ask Agent (Auto)`.
2. **Task:** "Find my last 3 notes about 'Phase 1' and write a summary of what we accomplished."
3. **Point out the logs:** Explain how the agent is "Thinking", then "Searching", then "Reading", and finally "Answering".

## Phase 3: Personalization & Senses
1. **Memory:** Run `Ask Agent (Auto)` -> "Remember that my birthday is October 10th."
2. **Recall:** Run `Ask Agent (Auto)` -> "When should I plan my party?" (Agent should mention Oct 10th).
3. **Vision:** Open a screenshot or diagram. Run `Analyze Current Image`. Ask: "Explain this diagram."
4. **Audio:** Open a voice note. Run `Transcribe Selected Audio File`. Show the new markdown note.

## Conclusion
Summarize how these 3 phases transformed a simple chat plugin into a truly intelligent Second Brain.
