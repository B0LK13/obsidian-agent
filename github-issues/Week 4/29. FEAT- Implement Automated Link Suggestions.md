# FEAT: Implement Automated Link Suggestions

**Labels:** feature,priority:high,ml  
**Milestone:** Week 4

---

**Problem Statement:**
The current system lacks the ability to automatically suggest relevant links between notes based on semantic similarity or shared concepts.

**Proposed Solution:**
Implement a machine learning-based link suggestion engine that analyzes the content of notes and suggests relevant connections based on semantic relationships, shared keywords, or conceptual overlap.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Suggest at least 5 relevant links for any given note
2. Achieve accuracy rate of at least 80% based on manual validation
3. Integrate seamlessly with existing note editing interface
4. Provide real-time link suggestions as user types or edits a note
