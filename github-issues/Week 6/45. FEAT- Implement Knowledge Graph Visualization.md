# FEAT: Implement Knowledge Graph Visualization

**Labels:** feature,priority:high,visualization  
**Milestone:** Week 6

---

**Problem Statement:**
The current system lacks the ability to visualize the relationships and connections between notes in the knowledge base as an interactive knowledge graph.

**Proposed Solution:**
Implement a knowledge graph visualization component that represents notes as nodes and their relationships as edges, allowing users to explore the structure and connections of their knowledge base.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Render a knowledge base containing 1000 notes and 5000 relationships within 5 seconds
2. Provide smooth interactive performance with panning, zooming, and node selection
3. Integrate seamlessly with existing note editing interface
4. Support different visualization layouts (force-directed, hierarchical, radial)
