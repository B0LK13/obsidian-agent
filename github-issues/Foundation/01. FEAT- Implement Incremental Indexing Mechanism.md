# FEAT: Implement Incremental Indexing Mechanism

**Labels:** feature,priority:high,performance  
**Milestone:** Foundation

---

**Problem Statement:**
The current indexing approach performs full re-indexing of the entire knowledge base on each update, resulting in poor performance, especially with large knowledge bases containing thousands of notes.

**Proposed Solution:**
Implement an incremental indexing mechanism that tracks changes to notes (additions, modifications, deletions) and updates the index incrementally based on these changes, rather than performing full re-indexing on each update.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The incremental indexing mechanism should process updates to 1000 notes within 10 seconds
2. Maintain index consistency with a correctness rate of at least 99.9% based on manual validation
3. Reduce average indexing time for subsequent updates by at least 80% compared to full re-indexing
4. Memory footprint should remain under 100MB during indexing operations
