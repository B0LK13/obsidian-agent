# FEAT: Implement Vector Database Layer for Semantic Search

**Labels:** feature,priority:high,enhancement  
**Milestone:** Foundation

---

**Problem Statement:**
The current search mechanism relies on traditional keyword-based search, which may not effectively capture the semantic relationships and contextual meaning of the content in the knowledge base.

**Proposed Solution:**
Implement a vector database layer that converts the content of notes into vector embeddings using a pre-trained language model, and enables semantic search capabilities that can retrieve relevant notes based on the semantic similarity of their content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Generate vector embeddings for 1000 notes within 60 seconds
2. Provide semantic search results with a relevance score of at least 0.8 for at least 80% of search queries
3. Memory footprint should remain under 500MB
4. Integrate seamlessly with existing search interface and functionality
