# REFACTOR: Separate Concerns in Indexing Module

**Labels:** refactor,priority:high,architecture  
**Milestone:** Week 2

---

**Problem Statement:**
The current indexing module mixes file system operations, data parsing, and index construction logic within the same module, resulting in a monolithic structure.

**Proposed Solution:**
Refactor the indexing module to separate concerns into distinct modules/classes for file system operations, data parsing, and index construction.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Refactored module consists of at least 3 distinct modules/classes
2. Clear interfaces and dependencies between modules
3. Process indexing of 1000 notes within same time frame as current system
4. Improved code maintainability and testability
