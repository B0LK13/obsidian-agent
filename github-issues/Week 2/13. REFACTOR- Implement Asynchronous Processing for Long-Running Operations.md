# REFACTOR: Implement Asynchronous Processing for Long-Running Operations

**Labels:** refactor,priority:high,async  
**Milestone:** Week 2

---

**Problem Statement:**
The current system performs long-running operations synchronously, blocking the user interface.

**Proposed Solution:**
Implement asynchronous processing using modern async techniques (async/await, Promises, observables) to perform operations in background without blocking UI.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Perform long-running operations asynchronously without blocking UI
2. Provide progress feedback and completion notifications
3. Maintain same level of functionality and performance
4. Support cancellation of in-progress operations
