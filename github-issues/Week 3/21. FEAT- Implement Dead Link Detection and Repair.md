# FEAT: Implement Dead Link Detection and Repair

**Labels:** feature,priority:high,reliability  
**Milestone:** Week 3

---

**Problem Statement:**
The current system lacks the ability to automatically detect and report broken internal links within the knowledge base.

**Proposed Solution:**
Implement a link validation and repair mechanism that scans all internal links in the knowledge base, identifies broken or invalid links, and provides suggestions for repairing or updating these links.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Detect at least 90% of broken internal links in a test knowledge base containing 1000 notes with 5000 internal links
2. Provide accurate repair suggestions for at least 80% of detected broken links
3. Integrate seamlessly with existing note editing and management interface
4. Run validation in background without blocking user interface
