# FEAT: Implement Caching and Optimization Layer

**Labels:** feature,priority:high,performance  
**Milestone:** Week 5

---

**Problem Statement:**
The current system lacks efficient caching mechanisms for frequently accessed notes, search results, and knowledge graphs, resulting in unnecessary disk I/O operations and increased latency.

**Proposed Solution:**
Implement a caching and optimization layer that provides in-memory caching for frequently accessed notes, search results, and knowledge graphs, employing optimization techniques like lazy loading, prefetching, and batch processing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Cache at least 1000 frequently accessed notes within 10 seconds
2. Achieve cache hit rate of at least 80% for subsequent accesses
3. Reduce average latency for common user interactions by at least 50%
4. Implement intelligent cache eviction policy
