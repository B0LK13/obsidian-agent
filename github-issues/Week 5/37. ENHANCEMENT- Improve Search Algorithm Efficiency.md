# ENHANCEMENT: Improve Search Algorithm Efficiency

**Labels:** enhancement,priority:medium,performance  
**Milestone:** Week 5

---

**Problem Statement:**
The current search algorithm may not be optimized for efficiency, potentially resulting in slow search response times.

**Proposed Solution:**
Enhance search algorithm with advanced data structures (inverted indexes, tries), optimize query parsing, implement caching, and explore advanced techniques (fuzzy search, synonyms).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Reduce average search response times by at least 30% for large knowledge bases (1000+ notes)
2. Maintain or improve search accuracy and relevance
3. Integrate seamlessly with existing search interface
