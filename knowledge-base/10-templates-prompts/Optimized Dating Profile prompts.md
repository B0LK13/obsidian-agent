## 1. Master Prompt Blueprint (copy/paste template)

### 1.1 Identity lock (use this in every prompt)

**Core instruction:**  
“Use the uploaded photo as the source. Preserve identity, facial structure, age, and expression. Do not change face shape, eye shape, nose, mouth, ethnicity, or signature features. Natural retouch only.”

### 1.2 Universal quality stack (append to every prompt)

“Photorealistic, high detail, clean skin texture (no plastic smoothing), natural pores, accurate skin tones, soft realistic lighting, sharp eyes, subtle bokeh, balanced contrast, professional color grading, no artifacts, no weird fingers/teeth, no warped jewelry/hair.”

### 1.3 Camera realism (choose one set)

- **Classic headshot:** “85mm lens, f/1.8, studio key light + soft fill, catchlights, shallow depth of field”
    
- **Lifestyle portrait:** “35mm lens, f/2.0, natural window light, candid realism”
    
- **Cinematic:** “50mm lens, f/1.8, soft rim light, gentle film grain, cinematic grade”
    

### 1.4 Negative prompt (paste once; tweak as needed)

“no CGI, no cartoon, no over-smoothing, no uncanny face, no waxy skin, no over-whitening teeth, no heavy makeup, no distorted background, no text, no watermark, no logo, no AI artifacts, no extra limbs, no mismatched earrings, no asymmetrical glasses.”

## 6. Practical deployment rules (so this actually performs)

- Keep **3–6 “core looks”** and rotate them monthly; consistency builds recognition.
    
- Lock identity changes: **no face reshaping** (people can smell it).
    
- Optimize for thumbnails: **sharp eyes + clean background** wins.
    
- Use a “house grade” (same warmth/contrast) so your grid/profile looks intentional.
    

If you tell me the primary platform (LinkedIn vs IG vs both) and your brand vibe (e.g., “cybersecurity operator,” “AI consultant,” “creator”), I can compress this into a tight “Top 12” set that matches a single coherent personal brand.
